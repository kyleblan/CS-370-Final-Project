# CS-370-Final-Project
Added project 2

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?:
In the context of the treasure hunter game project, I was tasked with developing an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze to find a hidden treasure. I was provided with initial code that defined the maze environment, including its layout and the agent's starting position. Additionally, some basic pathfinding algorithms were given as a foundation.

To create the agent's functionality, I wrote code that implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm using neural networks. This involved coding the neural network architecture to approximate Q-values, which represent the expected rewards for taking specific actions in certain states. I also developed the logic for the agent to interact with the environment, make decisions based on exploration and exploitation, and update its learning using reinforcement learning principles.

Throughout the project, I connected my learning from the course in various ways. I applied algorithmic knowledge to select and implement appropriate pathfinding strategies. My understanding of neural networks and Q-learning allowed me to design and train the agent effectively. The project highlighted the importance of efficient algorithms, proper data representation, and the synergy between learning and problem-solving.

Connect Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science:
Throughout the course, I've gained insights into various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. These fundamental skills are essential to computer science, a field that revolves around the study of algorithms, information processes, and the design and analysis of efficient solutions. Computer scientists innovate in fields like artificial intelligence, cryptography, software engineering, and more, ultimately shaping the technological landscape that underpins modern society.

Role and Importance of Computer Scientists:
Computer scientists research and develop innovative solutions to complex problems using computational tools and techniques. Their work spans diverse domains, from developing algorithms that power search engines to designing secure communication protocols. Computer scientists play a crucial role in driving technological advancements, improving efficiency, enhancing user experiences, and addressing societal challenges.

Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist:
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. I begin by understanding the problem's requirements, breaking it down into smaller components, and identifying potential algorithms or data structures that can be employed. I then design, implement, and test solutions, iterating as needed. Collaborative thinking and continuous learning are integral, as many problems involve creative adaptation of existing solutions or the creation of new ones.

Ethical Responsibilities to Users and Organizations:
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both end users and the organizations I work with. I must ensure that the solutions I create prioritize user safety, privacy, and well-being. This includes considering potential biases in algorithms, protecting user data, and adhering to legal and industry standards. Additionally, I am responsible for being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the solutions I provide, promoting ethical behavior within my organization, and contributing positively to society's technological progress.
